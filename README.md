# FerrisETW ðŸ¦€

This crate provides safe Rust abstractions over the ETW consumer APIs.

It started as a [KrabsETW](https://github.com/microsoft/krabsetw/) rip-off written in Rust (hence the name [`Ferris`](https://rustacean.net/) ðŸ¦€).
All credits go to the team at Microsoft who develop KrabsEtw, without it, this project probably wouldn't be a thing.<br/>
Since version 1.0, the API and internal architecture of this crate is slightly diverging from `krabsetw`, so that it is more Rust-idiomatic.

## Examples
You can find a examples within the
  [crate documentation on doc.rs](https://docs.rs/ferrisetw),
  as well as the [examples](./examples) and the [tests](./tests) folders.

If you are familiar with KrabsETW you'll see that is very similar.
In case you've never used KrabsETW before, the examples are very straight forward and should be easy to follow. If you have any issues don't hesitate in asking.


## Notes
- The project is still WIP.
  Feel free to report bugs, issues, feature requests, etc.
  Of course, contributing will be happily accepted!


- The types available for parsing are those that implement the trait TryParse for Parser, basic types are already
  implemented. In the near future I'll add more :)


- I tried to keep dependencies as minimal as possible, also you'll see I went with the new [windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) instead of
  using the [winapi](https://docs.rs/winapi/0.3.9/winapi/). This is a personal decision mainly because I believe the
  Windows bindings is going to be the "standard" to interact with the Windows API in the near future.


- Although I encourage everyone to use Rust, I do believe that, at the moment, if you plan on interacting
  with ETW in a production level and the programming language is not a constraint you should definitely
  go with **KrabsETW** as a more robust and tested option. Hopefully in next iterations I'll be able
  to remove this disclaimer ðŸ˜ƒ
